    <blockquote>
      “Friendship ... is born at the moment when one man says to another "What!
      You too? I thought that no one but myself . . .”
    </blockquote>
    <p>C.S Lewis</p>
    <blockquote>
      “If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can
      satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another
      world.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>C.S Lewis</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no
      survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to
      survival.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>C.S Lewis</p>
